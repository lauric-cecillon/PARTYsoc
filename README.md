# PARTYsoc
# A statistical model partitioning soil organic carbon (SOC) into its centennially active and stable fractions based on Rock-Eval thermal analysis

## USER MANUAL

### This short manual and the R scripts, R data file and csv file provided in this repository accompany the draft: "Partitioning soil organic carbon into its centennially active and stable fractions with statistical models based on Rock-Eval® thermal analysis (PARTYSOCv2.0 and PARTYSOCv2.0EU)"

### The R script entitled "partysocv2.0_partysocv2.0eu_Rscript_GMD" can be used to reproduce the models (PARTYsocv2.0 and PARTYsoc2.0eu statistical models) and results presented in the above-mentionned draft, using the csv file entitled "PARTYsocv2.0_GMD". This csv file contains the 40 Rock-Eval parameters of the 105 topsoil samples from seven reference sites described in the above-mentionned draft.

### The R script entitled "PARTYsocv2.0eu_prediction_Rscript_GMD" can be used to run directly the PARTYsocv2.0eu statistical model (i.e. predicting the size of the centennially active and stable SOC fraction in new topsoils), using 18 Rock-Eval parameters (measured on these new topsoils) as predictor variables. This R scripts uses the R data file entitled "PARTYsocv2.0eu_data_for_prediction_GMD".
